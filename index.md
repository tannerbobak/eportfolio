# Philosophy of Education
Passionate and hard-working student, research assistant, and future chemical engineer with the creativity and experience to implement innovative solutions to difficult problems using novel computer software. Skilled in chemistry, lab technique, data analysis, and a variety of scientific computing software.
# Coursework
* CHEN 2120 - Material and Energy Balance
* APPM 2360 - Differential Equations and Linear Algebra
* CSCI 2824 - Discrete Structures
# Creative Work
* Cave In! - I developed this game for Android devices using Unity3D and the C# programming language over the course of Fall 2014. It was created for my independent study: APPtitude: Application Development from Design to Market. I spent 120+ hours designing and programming for the game.
* CustomSpawners - Programmed a custom sever modification for Minecraft game servers using Java. This modification received over 50,000 downloads from all over the world. Aside from design and programming, I also handled customer support and product documentation.
# Technical Experience
* Dr. Loren Hough Lab - In the Hough Lab, I study how to derive the bending stiffness of microtubules within cells from fluorescence microscopy images using image analysis techniques implemented in Matlab. I have created extensive programs to conduct this analysis which are run locally or as large groups of jobs on a supercomputing cluster. We hope to use these programs to observe how mutations to tubulin, the protein making up microtubules, will affect microtubule stiffness. Knowing this, more effective treatments for diseases like cancers can be formulated.
* Dr. Michael Shirts Group - In the Shirts Group, I am studying how peptides bind to proteins using expanded ensemble molecular dynamics simulations. Such simulations model protein motion on the atomic scale and provide insights into the binding mechanisms and associated energies of protein-peptide interactions. We use this information to create tools for smarter and cheaper drug design. Our work in the Shirts Group will hopefully lead to treatments for ailments such as immunodeficiency or cancers.
# Service
* Computer Instructor at Pikes Peak Library District - I developed and taught summer programs about computer usage and programming to kids and adults alike. Recruited members from the programming club I founded to assist with instruction and allow them to further their own volunteer experience. 
* Construction Volunteer at Habitat for Humanity - I volunteered at the Habitat for Humanity site in Longmont, Colorado. I helped to build a new duplex unit to house two families.
* Volunteer at Maker Faire Denver - I volunteered at the Denver Maker Faire by helping with event setup and traffic control throughout the day.
# Leadership
* AIChE Chem-E Car Team Captain - I was a member and now team captian of the team that designed CU's 2017 Chemical Engineering Car, "Separation Anxiety". At competition, our car came within two centimeters of the target stopping distance of 22.4 meters, putting us in first place and qualifying us for the international competition.
* Programming Club - Founded and led a club focused on teaching programming and computer science to as many as 30 students during all four years of high school.
